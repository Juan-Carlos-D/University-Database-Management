    "# **Program Goals and Purpose**  \n",
    "The primary goal of our project was to design and develop a comprehensive system to evaluate degree programs within a university department. This system aimed to facilitate the collection, storage, and analysis of critical data to support ongoing program reviews. The solution needed to handle relational data, provide user-friendly interfaces, and accommodate future extensions such as new degree levels and evaluation methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Team Collaboration and Development Approach**  \n",
    "This project was a collaborative effort where our team worked together on both the backend and frontend components. By leveraging our collective expertise, we ensured a seamless integration between the two layers of the application. The backend was developed using Flask and Python, which allowed efficient communication with the frontend, implemented using HTML and JavaScript.  \n",
    "\n",
    "# **Database Design and Implementation**  \n",
    "We designed and implemented the database using SQL to ensure a robust and scalable structure for managing relational data. The database was engineered to store information on degrees, courses, instructors, sections, goals, and evaluations. Relationships between these entities were carefully constructed to reflect the program's requirements, such as associating courses with multiple degrees and tracking semester-specific data for course sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Key Features and Functionality**  \n",
    "Our system successfully supported the following core features:  \n",
    "1. **Data Entry:**  \n",
    "   - Input of degrees, courses, instructors, sections, and goals.  \n",
    "   - Association of courses with program goals.  \n",
    "   - Entry of semester-specific course and section data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Evaluation Management:**  \n",
    "   - Instructors could input evaluation data for each goal associated with their courses.  \n",
    "   - Support for multi-degree course evaluations by duplicating data entry for multiple programs.  \n",
    "   - Optional inclusion of improvement suggestions for subsequent semesters.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Querying Capabilities:**  \n",
    "   - Retrieval of degree-specific information, such as associated courses, sections, and goals.  \n",
    "   - Chronological listing of sections within a given time range.  \n",
    "   - Status tracking for evaluation completion and percentage-based performance analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Achievements and Impact**  \n",
    "Our team successfully developed a scalable and intuitive system that met all the project requirements outlined in the program description. The database and application design ensured extensibility, allowing the system to adapt to future needs. By integrating powerful querying capabilities, we empowered users to gain meaningful insights into degree evaluations and performance trends. This project demonstrated our ability to integrate backend, frontend, and database components into a cohesive solution, addressing the department's current and future program evaluation needs.\n",

    "## Development of the ER Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The creation of the database schema was a multi-step process that began with the design of an **Entity-Relationship (ER) Model**. This model served as a blueprint for understanding the key entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them. The process involved collaborative brainstorming, iterative refinements, and validations to ensure a robust design.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 1: Identifying Entities**\n",
    "We started by identifying the core entities required for the project based on the functional requirements:\n",
    "1. **Departments**: To represent academic departments offering degrees and courses.\n",
    "2. **Degrees**: To capture details of academic programs offered by departments.\n",
    "3. **Courses**: To store information about the courses offered in the curriculum.\n",
    "4. **Goals**: To represent learning objectives or program-level outcomes.\n",
    "5. **Instructors**: To store details about faculty members involved in teaching.\n",
    "6. **Sections**: To capture semester-specific information about course offerings.\n",
    "7. **Evaluations**: To track assessments of program goals through assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 2: Defining Attributes**\n",
    "Each entity was analyzed to identify its attributes. For example:\n",
    "- **Courses**: Attributes like `course_id`, `course_name`, `core_class`, and `dept_code`.\n",
    "- **Degrees**: Attributes like `degree_id`, `degree_name`, `level`, and `dept_code`.\n",
    "- **Goals**: Attributes like `goal_code` and `goal_desc`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Special care was taken to define unique identifiers (primary keys) for each entity to ensure data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 3: Establishing Relationships**\n",
    "Once the entities were defined, we focused on the relationships between them:\n",
    "- **Departments and Degrees**: A department can offer multiple degrees, but each degree belongs to one department.\n",
    "- **Degrees and Goals**: Each degree is associated with multiple goals, representing program-level objectives.\n",
    "- **Goals and Courses**: A goal can be addressed by multiple courses, and a course can contribute to multiple goals.\n",
    "- **Instructors and Sections**: Instructors are assigned to teach sections of courses.\n",
    "- **Sections and Evaluations**: Evaluations assess the achievement of goals within a specific section.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also considered cardinality (one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships) to accurately capture the real-world associations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 4: Refining the Model**\n",
    "We conducted multiple iterations of the ER Model, receiving feedback from team members and stakeholders. During this phase, we:\n",
    "- Added constraints like `UNIQUE` and `CHECK` to enforce business rules.\n",
    "- Simplified many-to-many relationships by introducing intermediary tables (e.g., `Goal_Courses` and `Degree_Goals`).\n",
    "- Validated the model against real-world scenarios to ensure its practicality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 5: Translating to Relational Schema**\n",
    "The finalized ER Model was converted into a relational schema. Each entity became a table, and relationships were implemented using **foreign keys**. For example:\n",
    "- The relationship between `Courses` and `Departments` was represented by a foreign key `dept_code` in the `Courses` table.\n",
    "- The many-to-many relationship between `Goals` and `Courses` was implemented using the `Goal_Courses` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 6: Implementation and Validation**\n",
    "After the schema was implemented, we populated the tables with sample data and tested the relationships through SQL queries. This helped us verify the integrity of the design and ensure the schema met the project requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Outcome**\n",
    "This process of developing the ER Model and translating it into a schema ensured that the database was both well-structured and aligned with the project's goals. The collaborative nature of the task allowed us to identify potential issues early and create a schema capable of handling complex queries and data relationships efficiently.\n",
